            <h3>Project 1: Detection of Fraud Job Recruitment Postings</h3>
            <p>In recent years, with the proliferation of modern technology and social communication, the prevalence of advertising new job opportunities has escalated. Consequently, detecting fake job postings has emerged as a pressing concern in todayâ€™s society.A BoW model using TF-IDF vectorizer and random forest model and A XGBoost classifier model is applied o tha data which gave us higher accuracy.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: YOLO ParkNet: Efficient Vehicle Detection for Smart Parking Management</h3>
            <p>Addressing the challenge of parking allocation on growing vehicle populations, this study presents a novel approach leveraging deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for vehicle object detection. With urban areas experiencing increased congestion and limited parking space availability, an intelligent system becomes imperative.By harnessing the power of CNNs, specifically tailored for object recognition, our proposed method efficiently identifies and classifies vehicles within parking areas.</p>
